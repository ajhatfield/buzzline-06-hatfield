The producer gets messages from the book_data.json folder in order to get the author, title, timestamp, reader, and rating of multiple different books and exchanges the information via a Kafka topic. The consumer takes the messages and analyzes how many readers have read each unique book. Once the consumer analyzes this, it live updates a bar graph the plots the most popular books by uising matplotlib. By looking at this producer and consumer, you can know what the most popular books are. 

## Task 1. Use Tools from Module 1 and 2

Before starting, ensure you have completed the setup tasks in <https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case> and <https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case> first. 
Python 3.11 is required. 

## Task 2. Copy This Example Project and Rename

Once the tools are installed, copy/fork this project into your GitHub account
and create your own version of this project to run and experiment with. 
Follow the instructions in [FORK-THIS-REPO.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/docs/FORK-THIS-REPO.md).

OR: For more practice, add these example scripts or features to your earlier project. 
You'll want to check requirements.txt, .env, and the consumers, producers, and util folders. 
Use your README.md to record your workflow and commands. 
    

## Task 3. Manage Local Project Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions in [MANAGE-VENV.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/docs/MANAGE-VENV.md) to:
1. Create your .venv
2. Activate .venv
3. Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.

## Task 4. Start Zookeeper and Kafka (2 Terminals)

If Zookeeper and Kafka are not already running, you'll need to restart them.
See instructions at [SETUP-KAFKA.md] to:

1. Start Zookeeper Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-7-start-zookeeper-service-terminal-1))
2. Start Kafka ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-8-start-kafka-terminal-2))

## Task 5. Start a Basic (File-based, not Kafka) Streaming Application

This will take two terminals:

1. One to run the producer which writes to a file in the data folder. 
2. Another to run the consumer which reads from the dynamically updated file. 

### Producer Terminal

Start the producer to generate the messages. 

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.producer_hatfield
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.producer_hatfield
```

### Consumer Terminal

Start the associated consumer that will process and visualize the messages. 

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.consumer_hatfield
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.consumer_hatfield
```

### Review the Application Code

Review the code for both the producer and the consumer. 
Understand how the information is generated, written to a file, and read and processed. 
Review the visualization code to see how the live chart is produced. 
When done, remember to kill the associated terminals for the producer and consumer. 


## Later Work Sessions
When resuming work on this project:
1. Open the folder in VS Code. 
2. Start the Zookeeper service.
3. Start the Kafka service.
4. Activate your local project virtual environment (.env).

## Save Space
To save disk space, you can delete the .venv folder when not actively working on this project.
You can always recreate it, activate it, and reinstall the necessary packages later. 
Managing Python virtual environments is a valuable skill.
